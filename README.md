dijkstra.cpp is a stand-alone dijkstra algorithm along with it's own minimum priority queue. 
I decided to implement templating to allow for various use cases for node naming conventions (i.e. ints or strings).
The main function has the adjacency list as well as the function call which can be adjusted for a specific source node.
